# JavaWordle
A java Application for wordle


There is two versions of this project: JavaWordle in IntelliJ, and JavaWordleEclipse which is the Eclipse port of this project (Both work as intended but eclipse requires slightly different imports)

For Eclipse, there is probably not a .jar that automatically launches the project, but for IDEA IntelliJ, the JAR executable can befound in JavaWordle/out/artifacts/JavaWordle_jar.

Known Issues:
-Cannot close program directly from a Game Over screen (Low Priority)
-Guss checker will occasionally label Right Letter, wrong spot letters as wrong letter. This can cause wordle difficulties. (High Priority)
